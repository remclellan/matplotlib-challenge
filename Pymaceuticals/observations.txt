Ramicane had the greatest impact on tumor volume during the course of the study with Capomulin as the only other to show a decrease during the timeframe.

The mice on both ketapril and the placebo both had the same survival rate by the end of the 45 days.

Infubinol which had a lower survival rate in the mice versus the placebo still had a slower spread than the placebo during the course of the study.
